# Javascript Fundamentals - Vintage-Digital-Watch - project


## Description

This is a simple watch app part of the projects from the course. The design was not enforced. I choose a vintage Casio digital watch model. It show time, date, day of the week. The Buttons work just like they would work on the original watch setting light, mode, stopwatch,stop/reset etc.


## Requirements were :

* Start with a simple app with a html, script and css file.

* Render a watch to the screen.

* Use JS Date object to extract time, day of week, day of month etc.

* Build a function that extracts all the info and use setTimeout() every 1 second.

* Render the info to the screen and a watch would do.

* Feel free to add extra features and style it as you wish.
